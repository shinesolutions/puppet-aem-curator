AEM Profiles and required artifacts
-----------------------------------

The table further below lists down the artifacts required for a given AEM profile.
The file names _must_ be identical to what's listed here. There is no obvious file name format because Adobe has historically been publishing the artifacts with inconsistent naming between versions.
